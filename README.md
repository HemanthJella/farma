First do this:

	clone repo
	cd djenofdjango

We have 2 apps in the 'apps' folder, so,

	cd djen_project 
		- For articles section

	cd quora 
		- For Q/A section

	(need to run each one seperately)


Now within 'djen_project', the article posting app is 'blog'
	
	where one can post an article and others can post comments to it



And within 'quora' , q/a app is 'core'

	where it only shows the questions added(as of now)
